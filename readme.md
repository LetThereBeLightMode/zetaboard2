The zetaboard project is a fully open source split keyboard with ortholinear layout. The project is built on vial-qmk (fork of the QMK project). All files are available for download, including PCB gerbers and hardware specifications. The project is fully reproducable, however I would love if you could support my development sourcing from my store ! - not available yet. 

**Future Development Roadmap**

* Matching thematic numberpad+macroboard
* Fully preassembled pick-n-place PCB design
* Fully available prebuilt sourcing
